#How A Plow Gets Tracked 

It's winter here in Chicago, which means one thing with absolutly certainity. 

Snow. 

In a city that does not stop for winter, it's vital that the streets get plowed so that residents can move about. For the past three years, the City of Chicago has run a plow tracker which allows residents to see where the plows are based on GPS devices inside the plows.. The site is also easily scrapable so that volunteer developers can build sites like Clearstreets.org that run on top of the platform. 

It would be easy to stop the story here. We built a thing, here's the thing, use the thing! 

But in reality, it's a lot more complicated to get the data from the streets to the website. So, we wanted to take a deep dive and do our own tracking as we follow the data from it's start to where it shows up on your screen. 

## Plow Trucks - The Unsung Heros of Winter

This is Plow Truck #S11701 just before a snow storm. It's parked on a main road with it's engines running in preperation for a long night of clearing the streets. These trucks are big Freightliners that are easily some of the largest vechiles on the road in the city. Armed with (?) pounds of salt and a thick heavy steel plow, they push snow to the side of the roads while dumping salt behind them. It's one of the reasons that you can't park on major thoroughfares in the winter - that's where the snow goes. Cars that don't move get at minimum a tidal wave of snow/salt slush thrown at your car or at worse the city will tow your car. 

The city also has attached 'quick-hitch' snow plows to about sixty garbage trucks to help stem the tide. 

Each of these trucks has a GPS device inside that sends location data back to Snow Command. It looks like this: 

It's a (?) brand that sends back signals via (?).
