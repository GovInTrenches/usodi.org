title: 'Food Inspection Data Apps'

When we go out to eat, we assume that the resturants we eat at are clean, safe, and healthy. In order to make sure that resturants are maintaining safe practicies, local governments all across the county inspect them on a regular basis. 

However, the health rating of a resturant isn't always displayed out in the open. And when it is, it doesn't always give you detailed information about the inspection. Did it have any faults? Were they serious? What makes something an "A" or "Pass" rating versus a "C" or "Fail" rating? 

Across the country, cities like [San Fransisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Health/Restaurant-Scores/stya-26eb), [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5), [New York](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/4vkw-7nck), and [Boston](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Health/Food-Establishment-Inspections/qndu-wx8w) are making this data available in bulk format. 

The issue is that it's not always easy for consumer to find this information out - particularly when they're out and about trying to find a place to eat. Thankfully, there are a few apps available that are taking this information and using it to help consumers make informed decisions.
